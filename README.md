    I selected 3 layers with 24 neurons each. After trying more layers and neurons, and epoch, I still cannot achieve targe model performance. 
    I tried with a different activation functions for hidden layers which is Leaky ReLU. 
    My computer slowed down and crashed after intalling Leaky ReLU. It even gave me error when I ran first codes which was to import dependencies.
    It was scary since everything run with error. It took me a lot of time to uninstall and re-install packages again.
    Therefore, I stopped here. Maybe I need a stronger computer.
